The Anti-Slanderinator

The Anti-Slanderinator is a program that detects whenever the user says a bad word and in return, sends an email to the email provided detailing the foul sin committed.

The first screen you see is one that prompts you to enter your information; first, last, and email.

Afterwards, once you press record, any and all bad words said by user <Hao Mai> will be sent to hmai015@ucr.edu.
This is to let their guardian know of the atrocities committed and to provide a safe space to all.
